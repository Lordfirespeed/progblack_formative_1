                <h1>Fighting the Climate Crisis with Robots</h1>
                <p>
                    I think it's fair to say the climate crisis is something that's close to everyone's hearts (If it
                    isn't close to yours, it should be). In recent years, there's been increasing pressure for climate
                    action, and in response there's been an increasing number of climate initiatives involving modern
                    technology. Let's take a look at a few!

                    <p>
                        Most people are aware of the basics: <b>trees are good for the environment.</b> Yes,
                        yes, algae do more work for the atmosphere than trees, blah, blah, blah. Let's focus on
                        'trees good', though: by extension, deforestation bad, and the opposite - 'afforestation' -
                        good. Some initiatives are automating the planting of large quantities of trees.

                    <h3>Planting With Drones</h3>
                    <p>
                        One strategy is using large drones, carrying 'seed ball packs', to distribute the seed balls
                        over a large, remote areas quickly. It's especially effective when it comes to replanting
                        forests damaged by wildfires, particularly in places less easily accessible by conventional
                        vehicles (cars).<br> Interestingly, aside from acorns or seeds, each 'seed ball' also contains
                        <i>chilli</i>; this prevents the seed balls from being eaten by local wildlife!

                    <h3>Planting With Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://milremrobotics.com/">Milrem Robotics</a> has designed two autonomous forester
                        vehicles, a <a href="https://milremrobotics.com/product/robotic-forester-planter/">planter</a>
                        and a <a href="https://milremrobotics.com/product/robotic-forester-brushcutter/">brushcutter</a>.
                        The planter can carry more than 300 seedlings at once and is capable of planting a hectare of
                        new forest in 5~6 hours, totalling between 1000 and 3500 seedlings in that time. It records and
                        communicates the exact location of each seedling to the brushcutter - which can then remove
                        competing vegetation around the seedlings.
