Interest of content:
The content was generally interesting, Good variety of topics with each one going into a good level of
detail for each topic. 

Consistency and quality of visual presentation:
Generally the sites were consistent in theme, the visual layout of images and paragraphs 
differed a lot between each site however, Creative solution for author information and overall clean site.
However some sites had a lot of unused space.

Quality of written presentation: Grammitically each page was written well, however some of the content came off
as unprofessional and condescending. 

Validity of HTML:
HTML was mostly valid according to validator.w3.org. An image on the F1 page was broken on both mobile
and non standard aspect ratio browser windows, Having to scroll sideways through the author info on a non standard aspect ratio
was also a bit weird, would be better if it was reordered

Evidence of collaboration:
Author info was all written and committed by other people
Some pages were far lengthier than others however they all had a good amount of content
Wasnt done last minute
